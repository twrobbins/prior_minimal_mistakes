I recently graduated with a masters degree in data science.  I previously worked as a CPA in Silicon Valley, mainly working with software-as-a-service (SaaS) companies on revenue recogniton.  I'm seeking a challenging position that will enable me to combine my data science skills with my domain expertise.
